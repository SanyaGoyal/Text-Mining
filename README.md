# Text-Mining- Game of Thrones 

This project is aimed at using text mining techniques to summarize the latest season finale of Game of Thrones to see if topic modelling techniques can help bring out the significant themes in each finale eposide. 

I found that the LDAvis algorithm in R was quite good in reflecting the on-going story line in terms of picking the right set of words and characters in each topic.

I also created a Tableau visualization of the character-wise sentiment score which shows the average sentiment score of each character based on the finale season.
